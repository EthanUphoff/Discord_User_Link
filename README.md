## Discord_User_Link
A bot for creating Discord profile links and getting user information
### Why this bot?
This bot was created because I was tired of making a link to my discord profile to send to people so I created a bot which does it for me. This bot can also give some basic information about a user in a server.
### How to Run
1. Clone or download the project
2. Run ``npm install`` in the projects directory
3. Put your Discord bot token in bot.login() which can be found in bot.js
4. Run ``node bot`` to start the bot
